            <p>
                <span>Overall, the movement for women’s rights has proven to be effective.</span> We can see in the data that almost all of the 52 included countries have given women full access to basic rights. 92.3% of the countries give women voting rights, and 63.5% countries give women access to the justice system. In spite of the different classifications, with 33% developed countries, 48% developing countries, and 19% least developing countries, the majority of the countries have still managed to give women basic rights. The difference in classification of countries did not seem to affect the overall women rights of the sample.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <span>Still, the movement for women’s rights still has a long way to go.</span> There are still 7.69% of countries that do not offer women voting rights. There are also still 36.5% of countries that give women only limited access to the justice system. The movement’s goal is to achieve women’s rights in every place in the world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <span>Our data suggests that traditions, culture, and certain factors in countries may affect women’s rights.</span> An example is in the variable women’s universal right to vote, wherein the  only 4 countries (Qatar, Bahrain, UAE, and Saudi Arabia) that prohibit women from voting are countries in the Middle East. It may be possible that conservative/traditional beliefs in some countries all over the world restrict women from basic rights.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <span>We conclude that the movement for women’s rights has made an outstanding impact on the world.</span> From the old times where women were only treated as housewives and objects, our society has evolved to empower women to make a world where they can be on the same level as men. We hope that our project may also spread awareness on this matter so that the movement may gain more support.
